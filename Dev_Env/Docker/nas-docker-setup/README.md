- **tests/**: Contains scripts for health checks and service tests.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nas-docker-setup
   ```

2. **Run the Setup Script**: 
   Execute the setup script to create the necessary directory structure and install Docker.
   ```bash
   bash scripts/nas-setup-complete.sh
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Usage

  - Start services: `bash scripts/start.sh`
  - Stop services: `bash scripts/stop.sh`
  - Backup: `bash scripts/backup.sh`
  - Restore: `bash scripts/restore.sh`
  - Maintenance: `bash scripts/maintenance.sh`
