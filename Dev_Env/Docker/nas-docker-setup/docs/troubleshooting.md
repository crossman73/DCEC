# Troubleshooting Tips for NAS Docker Environment

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Docker Service Not Starting
- **Issue**: Docker fails to start after installation.
- **Solution**: Check if the Docker service is enabled and running. Use the command:
  ```
  sudo systemctl start docker
  sudo systemctl enable docker
  ```

### 2. Docker Compose Not Found
- **Issue**: The command `docker-compose` returns "command not found".
- **Solution**: Ensure Docker Compose is installed. You can install it using:
  ```
  sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.24.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  ```

### 3. Permission Denied Errors
- **Issue**: You encounter permission denied errors when running scripts or accessing directories.
- **Solution**: Ensure you have the correct permissions. You may need to run commands with `sudo` or adjust directory permissions:
  ```
  sudo chown -R $(whoami):users /volume1/docker
  sudo chmod -R 755 /volume1/docker
  ```

### 4. Services Not Responding
- **Issue**: Services are not accessible via their URLs.
- **Solution**: Check if the services are running with:
  ```
  docker-compose ps
  ```
  If they are not running, check the logs for errors:
  ```
  docker-compose logs <service_name>
  ```

### 5. Health Check Failures
- **Issue**: Health checks for services fail.
- **Solution**: Ensure that the services are properly configured and that the necessary ports are open. Review the service configuration files for any misconfigurations.

### 6. Backup and Restore Issues
- **Issue**: Backup scripts fail to create or restore backups.
- **Solution**: Ensure that the backup directory exists and has the correct permissions. Check the logs for any specific error messages.

### 7. Configuration File Errors
- **Issue**: Services fail to start due to configuration file errors.
- **Solution**: Validate the configuration files for syntax errors. Use tools like `nginx -t` for Nginx configuration files to check for errors.
